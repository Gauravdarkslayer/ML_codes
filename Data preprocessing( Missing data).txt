how to deal with missing data.

1. We can remove the whole record where the data is missing.(But it can be dangerous).
2. We can find out the mean of the observations where the data is missing. And then place that mean value where the data is missing.


So, let's start woth python:
	
1. from sklearn.preprocessing import Imputer
	##Here sklearn(scikit learn contains amazing liabraries).
	##Preprocessing is the liabrary which contains useful classes for making machine learning models.
	##Imputer is the class by which we can handle our data.

2. imputer = Imputer(missing_values = 'NaN',strategy = 'mean',axis = 0)
	#Here, imputer is a object created by us for Imputer class.
	#missing_values is a parameter where we are going to check 	that where is NaN values i.e. missing values.
	#strategy, where we can perform operations. Default is mean. 	We can also use mode or median. Which is also a good strategy.
	#Axis, 0 for calculations on columns and 1 for rows.
3. imputer = imputer.fit(X[: , 1:3]) 
	#imputer is again a object we are assigning values to.
	.fit is a method to get the values from the matrix which is X here.
	X already contains our dataset.
	We are only choose the right column where the data is missing.
	The reason for we write 3 is upperbound is excluded.
4. X[: , 1:3] = imputer.transform(X[: , 1:3])	
	#X[: , 1:3] bcuz we just wanna transform these two columns.
	#.transform() is a method which is going to replace missing 	data with mean values.
	#.transform(X[: , 1:3]) bcuz we have missing values only in these 	two columns.

If you can't see the full array ,just run np.set_printoptions(threshold = np.nan)

So, let's start woth Ruby:

1. dataset$Age =ifelse(is.na(dataset$Age),ave(dataset$Age, FUN = function(x) mean(x, na.rm= TRUE)),
	dataset$Age)

	#dataset$age = To select only age column of out dataset.
	ifelse() = It's a function which have 3 parameters. 1st is testing , 2nd is if true, 3rd is if false.
	is.na() =checks if the missing value present in our dataset$Age 	or not.
	ave = predefined function which returns average.
	FUN = to declare a function.
	function(x) mean(x, na.rm)= mean function. That mean that we 	ask R to include the missing values.
